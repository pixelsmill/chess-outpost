          <h2>What is an Outpost?</h2>
          <p>
            In chess, an <strong>outpost</strong> is a piece (typically a
            knight) placed on an advanced square where it cannot be attacked by
            enemy pawns. These pieces control key squares and exert long-term
            pressure on the opponent's position, making them strategically
            valuable assets.

          <h2>Identify Strong and Weak Squares</h2>
          <p>
            This application helps you visualize and understand
            <strong>square control</strong> in chess positions. Through advanced
            board visualization, you can identify which squares are
            well-defended, which are weak points in your opponent's position,
            and where your pieces can establish powerful outposts to dominate
            the game.
